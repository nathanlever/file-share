##  File-Share

File-Share allows for quick and easy peer-to-peer file sharing between Urbit ships. Anyone with the app installed can send and receive files. File-Share also allows users to send files to their own ships, making it a convenient option for sharing files between devices.

The first table below the Submit button displays information about the app's storage. The Storage Capacity sets a limit for how much space the app is allowed to use of the user's ship. By setting an appropriate Storage Capacity the user can avoid receiving files whose size exceed the available space of the user's ship. The storage is mainly occupied by received files. However, when submitting a file for sharing, the submitted file will briefly be stored in the sender's storage until the file has been received by the receiver's ship. This means that before sending a file the sender has to make sure that the sender has enough storage space available for the file that is intended to be sent.

Comets cannot use File-Share and Galaxies cannot currently use File-Share.
